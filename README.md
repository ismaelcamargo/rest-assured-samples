# Overview

This project contains sample Java code, demonstrating how to use the 
[REST-Assured](https://github.com/jayway/rest-assured) library 
for testing a RESTful web service.
The tests are implemented with [JUnit](http://junit.org/junit4/), 
so that they are easy to run and easy to verify with the extensive 
[Assert](http://junit.org/junit4/javadoc/latest/org/junit/Assert.html) 
methods.

# To run the tests

Use [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) 
to run the tests:

`mvn test`
